A gulp + react + redux with support for es15 and react syntax

This project was created with the intention of a sandbox for learning react and redux or any other technology that you want
without the complexity of various others base projects that are out there.

#Prerequisites

* node > 4.4.3
* npm which it is included with node

#Installation

Run:

* bower install
* npm install

Then just run

gulp

#Changelog

More abstract development on this project it's planned for the near future but for the moment this is just a sandbox project to mess with, if you are learning something like angular,redux,react, vue etc etc because at this phase this project it's "framework agnostic"
so you can go and add your favorite library.

Changes on hold include:

* New development branch where new features will be added to the project.
* on development branch react and redux examples will be added for reference to anyone who wants it.

Please feel free to contribute to this project by sending me a pull request or fork it for yourself and enjoy the journey.
